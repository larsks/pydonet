Version 2 (pdnt0002) 2008-Match-25

  - Messages generated by hpt (from the Husky project) don't have
    NULL-terminated bodies.  I think this is in violation of FTS-0001, 
    but I've fixed Pydonet so that it won't choke on these messages.

Version 1 (pdnt0001) 2008-March-23

  - Initial release.
